## 🎯 Video Structure (Total: ~15 minutes)

### INTRO SEGMENT (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Show Cursor with MCP settings panel open]**

**Script**: 
> "Hi everyone! Today I'm going to show you something really exciting - MCP tools that supercharge AI assistants with real capabilities. I have 8 different tools configured here that let AI interact with GitHub, manage files, automate browsers, and much more. Let's dive in!"

**[Screen: Show the MCP tools list]**
> "As you can see, I have tools for git operations, GitHub API, filesystem management, browser automation with Puppeteer, and even real-time documentation lookup. Let's see them in action!"

---

### SEGMENT 1: Git & GitHub Integration (4 minutes)

**[Screen: Open Cursor chat]**

#### Demo 1.1: Git Status Check
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Can you check the current git status of my project and show me the last 3 commits?"
```

**Expected AI Actions**: 
- Uses `mcp_git-status_git-status`
- Uses `mcp_git-status_git-log`

**Narration while AI works**:
> "Watch how the AI uses the git-status tool to check our repository state. This is much more powerful than just asking about git - it's actually running git commands."

#### Demo 1.2: GitHub Repository Management
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Show me information about this repository on GitHub and list any open issues."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_github_get_repository`
- Uses `mcp_github_list_issues`

**Narration**:
> "Now it's connecting to GitHub's API to get real repository data. This integration means the AI has access to live information, not just training data."

#### Demo 1.3: Create GitHub Issue
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Create a new GitHub issue titled 'Add Dark Mode Toggle' with a description asking for a dark/light theme switcher for the React app."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_github_create_issue`

**Narration**:
> "Perfect! The AI just created a real GitHub issue. This shows how MCP tools bridge the gap between conversation and actual development workflows."

---

### SEGMENT 2: Filesystem Operations & Code Editing (4 minutes)

#### Demo 2.1: Read and Analyze Code
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Read my App.jsx file and explain what the current React app does."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_filesystem_read_text_file` or `read_file`

**Narration**:
> "The filesystem tool gives AI direct access to our project files. It can read, analyze, and understand our actual codebase."

#### Demo 2.2: Create New Component
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Create a new React component called 'DarkModeToggle.jsx' in the src folder that provides a button to toggle between light and dark themes. Use modern React hooks and make it visually appealing."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_filesystem_write_file` or `write`
- Creates the new component file

**Narration**:
> "Now watch as the AI creates a completely new React component file. It's not just generating code - it's actually writing files to our project."

#### Demo 2.3: Integrate Component
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Now modify my App.jsx file to import and use the DarkModeToggle component, and add the necessary CSS variables for theming."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_filesystem_edit_file` or `search_replace`
- Modifies existing files

**Narration**:
> "This is where it gets really powerful - the AI is editing our existing code, making the integration seamless. Let's see the result!"

**[Screen: Show the browser with the updated app]**

---

### SEGMENT 3: Advanced Problem Solving (3 minutes)

#### Demo 3.1: Sequential Thinking
**Say to AI**: 
```
"I want to add user authentication to my React app with login, signup, and protected routes. Use sequential thinking to break this down into a comprehensive implementation plan."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking`
- Shows step-by-step thinking process

**Narration**:
> "The sequential thinking tool helps AI break down complex problems systematically. Watch how it thinks through this multi-step challenge, revising and refining the approach."

#### Demo 3.2: Documentation Lookup
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Look up the latest React Router documentation and show me examples of implementing protected routes."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id`
- Uses `mcp_context7_get-library-docs`

**Narration**:
> "The Context7 tool provides access to up-to-date library documentation. Instead of relying on potentially outdated training data, it fetches current information."

---

### SEGMENT 4: Browser Automation (3 minutes)

#### Demo 4.1: Connect and Screenshot
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Connect to my Chrome browser, navigate to localhost:5173, and take a screenshot of my React app."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_connect_active_tab`
- Uses `mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_navigate`
- Uses `mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_screenshot`

**Narration**:
> "Puppeteer integration means AI can actually control browsers! This opens up possibilities for automated testing, web scraping, and user experience validation."

#### Demo 4.2: Interact with App
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Click the counter increment button 5 times and then take another screenshot to show the changed state."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses `mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_click` (multiple times)
- Uses `mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_screenshot`

**Narration**:
> "The AI is actually interacting with our app like a user would. This could be used for automated testing, user flow validation, or accessibility checking."

---

### SEGMENT 5: Integration & Workflow (2 minutes)

#### Demo 5.1: Complete Workflow
**Say to AI**: 
```
"Now let's put it all together. Take a screenshot of our current app, commit the changes we made to git, and update the GitHub issue we created earlier with a comment about the progress."
```

**Expected AI Actions**:
- Uses Puppeteer for screenshot
- Uses git tools for commit
- Uses GitHub tools for issue update

**Narration**:
> "This is the real power of MCP tools - they work together to create complete workflows. The AI just coordinated between multiple tools to accomplish a complex task that would normally require switching between many different applications."

---

### CONCLUSION SEGMENT (1 minute)

**[Screen: Show all the changes made during the demo]**

**Script**:
> "In just 15 minutes, we've seen AI tools that can manage git repositories, interact with GitHub, edit files, solve complex problems step-by-step, control browsers, and access real-time documentation. But the real magic happens when these tools work together - creating workflows that are more than the sum of their parts."

> "These MCP tools transform AI from a text generator into a genuine development partner. They bridge the gap between conversation and action, making AI assistants truly useful for real development work."

> "Thanks for watching! If you want to set up these tools yourself, check out the documentation I've created. The future of AI-assisted development is here, and it's pretty amazing!"

## 🎯 Key Talking Points During Recording

### Emphasize These Concepts:

1. **Real Integration**: "This isn't simulated - the AI is actually performing these actions"
2. **Live Data**: "The AI has access to current, real-time information"
3. **Workflow Automation**: "Multiple tools working together create powerful workflows"
4. **Developer Productivity**: "This saves hours of manual work"
5. **Practical Applications**: "These solve real development problems"

### Visual Cues to Capture:

- ✅ MCP tools list in Cursor settings
- ✅ AI tool calls happening in real-time
- ✅ Files being created/modified
- ✅ Browser automation in action
- ✅ GitHub interface showing created issues
- ✅ Git status and commit history
- ✅ Final working application

## 🔧 Backup Demos (If Something Doesn't Work)

### If GitHub Tool Fails:
**Say instead**: "Let me show you the filesystem capabilities by creating a more complex component structure."

### If Puppeteer Fails:
**Say instead**: "Let me demonstrate the documentation lookup tool with a different library."

### If Any Tool Fails:
**Keep narrating**: "Sometimes tools have connectivity issues, but that's the reality of working with external services. Let me show you another capability..."
