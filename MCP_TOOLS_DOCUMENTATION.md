```bash
# 1. Start your React app
cd /Users/narayan/Developer/newfinaldemoformademcps
npm run dev

# 2. Start Chrome with debugging (for Puppeteer)
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222

# 3. Open your project in Cursor
# Your MCP tools are already configured!
```

### Demo Conversation Starters
